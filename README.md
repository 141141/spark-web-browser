# Spark Web Browser
This is the source code for a very simple web browser, Spark.

Spark was created with Xcode 5 on OS X 10.9. Since then, support for OS X 10.9 has been dropped. The latest version of Spark has been tested with Xcode 7 GM on Yosemite 10.10.5.<br />
<b>Support for OS X 10.11 El Capitan is coming soon. As of now, Spark is broken on 10.11 because of WebKit issues.</b>
