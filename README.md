# Spark Web Browser
A minimal web browser for OS X

Spark was created with Xcode 5 on OS X 10.9. Since then, support for OS X 10.9 has been dropped. The latest version of Spark has been tested with Xcode 7 GM on Yosemite 10.10.5.<br />
<b>Reminder: Spark is non-functional on OS X 10.11 El Capitan.</b>

If you want to fix Spark for use on OS X 10.11 El Capitan, feel free to create a pull request.
