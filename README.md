# Spark Web Browser for OS X

## About

Spark is a simple, lightweight browser for Windows and OS X built with the [WebKit](https://webkit.org) browser engine.

Although being lightweight and easy-to-use, Spark is fast and powerful, and can load webpages in *seconds*.

Spark for OS X is compatible with OS X 10.11 El Capitan and later. Earlier versions of OS X might work, but are not supported.

## Custom Builds

In order to build Spark for OS X, you need to have Xcode 7 and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

Git is downloadable [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Xcode is downloadable within the Mac App Store.

#### Instructions:

Clone a copy of the main Spark for OS X git repo by running:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/insleep/spark-web-browser.git
```

Open `Spark.xcodeproj`, located in the `SparkWebBrowser` directory of Spark for OS X.

Make any necessary changes and compile Spark within Xcode.

The compiled version of Spark will be put in the `build/` subdirectory, along with other required files.
