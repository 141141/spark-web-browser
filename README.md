# Spark Web Browser
A minimal web browser for OS X

## About
Spark is a very simple web browser for OS X. It was not designed for normal use - it was designed for others to learn from. Feel free to fork this project and make improvements!

Spark was created with Xcode 5 on OS X 10.9. Since then, support for OS X 10.9 and 10.10 has been dropped. Currently, Spark supports all versions of OS X 10.11 El Capitan.<br />

## Install
Installation is easy. Just download the project, open it up using Xcode 7 or newer, and compile Spark using the "Run" button built into Xcode.
