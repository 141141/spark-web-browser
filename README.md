## About

Spark is a simple, lightweight browser for Windows and macOS built with the [WebKit](https://webkit.org) browser engine.

Although being lightweight and easy-to-use, Spark is fast and powerful, and can load webpages in *seconds*.

Spark for macOS is compatible with macOS 10.11 El Capitan and later. Earlier versions of macOS might work, but are not supported.
